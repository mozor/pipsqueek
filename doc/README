1.  NAME

	PipSqueek - More than just a friendly bot!

2. INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION

	See the file 'INSTALL' for help on installation and configuration

3.  DESCRIPTION

	PipSqueek is an automaton or 'bot' for IRC (Internet Relay Chat).
	Most IRC bots you will find are designed for protecting a channel from
	hostile takeovers or flooding.  This is not the sort of work PipSqueek
	is meant to be doing (although it is flexible enough to support it).

	PipSqueek was created to be a sort of 'channel pet' for IRC channels.
	This means it will keep notes of the users, store stats and quotes, 
	and try to be as helpful as possible without being in the way.
	Many IRC users live and swear by the "PipSqueek way of life" :-)

4.  AUTHOR

	PipSqueek is written and maintained by Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net>

5.  REPORTING BUGS / FEATURE REQUESTS

	All bugs should be sent to pipsqueek@l8nite.net with the word 'Bug' in
	the subject.  Feature requests should be sent to the same address, but
	with the word 'Request' in the subject.

8.  CREDITS

	trapper <trapper@arcanum.co.nz>
	
		trapper wrote 'subordinate', which the original pipsqueek 
		(v0.1) was based on.

	slyfx <slyfx@slyfx.com>
	
		slyfx wrote the original pipsqueek and helped co-author the 
		first few updates to the code.  He gave up the project to move
		on to other things, but I could not have started without him

	Wolfjourn <wolfjourn@wolfjourn.net>

		Wolfjourn provided a stable host for testing pipsqueek when I 
		did not have access to any other shell environments.  (Yes, I
		have to admit that PipSqueek was developed on Windows when it
		was first started :/).  Wolfjourn also spent many a long night
		helping to troubleshoot and come up with new features.

	mark <mark@sporkstorms.org>

		mark contributed the first XML-based quote interface and an
		elite karma module too.  He has also provided debugging help,
		hosting, documentation, and ideas for the bot.

	Cyon <cyon@bestweb.net>

		Cyon just showed up one day and gave irc.topgamers.net a very
		nice server/network to run off of.  In addition, he has spent
		a lot of time helping manage, debug, and run pipsqueek for
		the various users on irc.topgamers.net.
